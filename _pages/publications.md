My mathematical research interests revolve around understanding the large-scale behaviour of strongly correlated random systems. I enjoy studying phase transitions in interacting particle systems and random geometry. 

In my current position at Durham University, I work with [Sunil Chhita](https://www.durham.ac.uk/staff/sunil-chhita/) to investigate the rough-smooth boundary in the two-periodic Aztec diamond.

I completed my PhD at the [SAMBa](https://samba.ac.uk/) centre for doctoral training in statistical applied mathematics at the University of Bath under the supervision of [Alexandre Stauffer](https://sites.google.com/site/alexandrestauffer/home). My thesis was awarded the Royal Statistical Society prize for best in the field of applied probability completed between 2020 and 2022. At SAMBa I also completed a Master of Research with a focus on machine learning, applied statistics and numerical linear algebra.

# Further interests

The problem of the [longest increasing subsequence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Longest_increasing_subsequence) of a random permuation reveals surprisingly deep and beautiful mathematics. The famous [Baik-Deift-Johansson theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baik%E2%80%93Deift%E2%80%93Johansson_theorem) states that the length of the longest increasing subsequence of a large random permutation after rescaling is approximately the largest eigenvalue of a random matrix in the Gaussian unitary ensemble. What does a combinatorial problem have to do with random matrix theory? I would recommend Dan Romik's [The Surprising Mathematics of Longest Increasing Subsequences](https://www.cambridge.org/core/books/surprising-mathematics-of-longest-increasing-subsequences/F55A82ACEE3E0F78EE8968D3C42FB45C) to find out more. Learning about the problem of longest increasing subsequences of random permutations motivated me to pursue problems in two-dimensional random geometry.
