My mathematical research interests revolve around understanding the large-scale behaviour of strongly correlated random systems. I enjoy studying phase transitions in interacting particle systems and random geometry. 

In my current position at Durham University, I work with [Sunil Chhita](https://www.durham.ac.uk/staff/sunil-chhita/) to investigate the rough-smooth boundary in the two-periodic Aztec diamond.

I completed my PhD at the [SAMBa](https://samba.ac.uk/) centre for doctoral training in statistical applied mathematics at the University of Bath under the supervision of [Alexandre Stauffer](https://sites.google.com/site/alexandrestauffer/home). My thesis was awarded the Royal Statistical Society prize for best in the field of applied probability completed between 2020 and 2022. At SAMBa I also completed a Master of Research with a focus on machine learning, applied statistics and numerical linear algebra.

# Further interests

Below I list some topics in probability that I believe are important, interesting and close to my own research.

## Longest increasing subsequences in random permutations

The problem of the [longest increasing subsequence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Longest_increasing_subsequence) of a random permuation reveals surprisingly deep and beautiful mathematics. The famous [Baik-Deift-Johansson theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baik%E2%80%93Deift%E2%80%93Johansson_theorem) states that the length of the longest increasing subsequence of a large random permutation after rescaling is approximately the largest eigenvalue of a random matrix in the Gaussian unitary ensemble. What does a combinatorial problem have to do with random matrix theory? I would recommend Dan Romik's [The Surprising Mathematics of Longest Increasing Subsequences](https://www.cambridge.org/core/books/surprising-mathematics-of-longest-increasing-subsequences/F55A82ACEE3E0F78EE8968D3C42FB45C) to find out more. Learning about the problem of longest increasing subsequences of random permutations motivated me to pursue problems in two-dimensional random geometry.

## Phase transitions in statistical physics

Many important problems in physics and computer science involve phase transitions where a small change in conditions leads to a substantial change in the large-scale behaviour. [Percolation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Percolation_theory) is the simplest model in statistical physics that observes a non-trivial phase transition and has captured the imagination of mathematicians for over sixty years. In percolation, each edge on a given graph is deleted with some probability, independently of every other edge. While simple to define, percolation has emerged as one of the most important models in modern probability theory. In the last twenty years, three Fields medals have been awarded for contributions to percolation theory. I would suggest the [lecture notes](https://arxiv.org/abs/1712.04651) of the most recent recipient Hugo Duminil-Copin for an introduction to percolation.

## Spread of infection models

Modelling the spread of an infection or rumour on a network has clear practical applications but these models are also mathematically rich. One is interested in whether the infection dies out eventually or whether it survives, and if it survives, then can we describe the shape of the infection in a population? A simple but challenging model is the spread of an infection through a sea of random walk particles. A recent breakthrough is the work of [Dauvergne and Sly](https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.06037) that describes how the infected particles form an annulus and leave behind a density of particles that never see the infection again.
