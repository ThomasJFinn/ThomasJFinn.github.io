I'm a junior data scientist at [Featurespace](https://www.featurespace.com/) where I build machine learning models on large, dynamic datasets to prevent fraud in real-time. 

## Mathematical research

Before joining Featurespace I researched strongly correlated random systems.

I completed my PhD at the [SAMBa](https://samba.ac.uk/) centre for doctoral training in statistical applied mathematics and held postdoctoral research positions at Durham University and the University of Bath.
