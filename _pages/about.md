🏫 I'm a mathematician at Durham University.

🔬 I enjoy using probabilistic techniques to understand strongly correlated random processes.

🤖 I have a strong interest in deep learning, AI safety and ensuring advances in machine learning benefits humanity.

## ∞ Mathematical research

I completed my PhD at the [SAMBa](https://samba.ac.uk/) centre for doctoral training in statistical applied mathematics.

My thesis was awarded the [Royal Statistical Society prize](https://www.bath.ac.uk/announcements/the-royal-statistical-society-prize-awarded/) for best in the field of applied probability completed between 2020 and 2022 and the Edward Fraenkel prize for best in the department of mathematical sciences.

My research on phase transitions in random competition models is published in the [Journal of the European Mathematical Society](https://ems.press/journals/jems/articles/8736482) and the [Annals of Applied Probability](https://projecteuclid.org/journals/annals-of-applied-probability/volume-32/issue-6/Coexistence-in-competing-first-passage-percolation-with-conversion/10.1214/22-AAP1792.short).

## 🚨 AI safety

I'm participating in the [BlueDot Impact](https://aisafetyfundamentals.com/) early 2024 AI alignment course to learn more about problems in AI alignment.

I'm a member of the [SatisfIA](https://pik-gane.github.io/satisfia/) research group to investigate aspiration-based reinforcement learning.

## ♘ Chess improvement

After starting to play in late 2022, chess improvement is one of my favourite hobbies and I document my journey here.
