🏫 I'm a junior data scientist at TEXT.

🔬 Previously I research phase transitions in strongly correlated random processes that are inspired by models in physics and computer science.

🤖 I have a strong interest in deep learning, AI safety and ensuring advances in machine learning benefits humanity.

🦾 Please contact me if you're excited to discuss anything on my website in more detail!

## ∞ Mathematical research

I completed my PhD at the [SAMBa](https://samba.ac.uk/) centre for doctoral training in statistical applied mathematics.

My thesis received the [Royal Statistical Society prize](https://www.bath.ac.uk/announcements/the-royal-statistical-society-prize-awarded/)  in applied probability (2020-2022) and the Edward Fraenkel prize (2021-2022) in the Department of Mathematical Sciences at the University of Bath.

My research on phase transitions in random competition models is published in the [Journal of the European Mathematical Society](https://ems.press/journals/jems/articles/8736482) and the [Annals of Applied Probability](https://projecteuclid.org/journals/annals-of-applied-probability/volume-32/issue-6/Coexistence-in-competing-first-passage-percolation-with-conversion/10.1214/22-AAP1792.short).

## 🚨 AI safety

I'm participating in the [BlueDot Impact](https://aisafetyfundamentals.com/) early 2024 AI alignment course to learn more about problems in AI alignment.

## ♘ Chess improvement

After starting to play in late 2022, chess improvement is one of my favourite hobbies and I document my journey here.
