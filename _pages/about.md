I'm a junior data scientist at [Featurespace](https://www.featurespace.com/) where I build machine learning models on large and dynamic datasets to prevent fraud in real-time. 

## Research Career

Before joining Featurespace I researched strongly correlated random systems in postdoctoral positions at Durham University and the University of Bath.

I completed my PhD at [SAMBa](https://samba.ac.uk/) investigating random competition models.
