🏫 I'm a mathematician at Durham University.

🔬 I enjoy using probabilistic techniques to understand phenomena in complex systems.

🤖 I have a strong interest in deep learning, AI safety and ensuring advances in machine learning benefits humanity.

# Overview

## ∞ Mathematical research

I completed my PhD at the [SAMBa](https://samba.ac.uk/) centre for doctoral training in statistical applied mathematics.

My thesis was awarded the inaugural [Royal Statistical Society prize](https://www.bath.ac.uk/announcements/the-royal-statistical-society-prize-awarded/) for best in the field of applied probability completed between 2020 and 2022.

My research on phase transitions in random competition models is published in the [Journal of the European Mathematical Society](https://ems.press/journals/jems/articles/8736482) and the [Annals of Applied Probability](https://projecteuclid.org/journals/annals-of-applied-probability/volume-32/issue-6/Coexistence-in-competing-first-passage-percolation-with-conversion/10.1214/22-AAP1792.short).

## 🚨 AI safety

I'm participating in the [BlueDot Impact](https://aisafetyfundamentals.com/) early 2024 AI alignment course to learn more about problems in AI alignment.

I'm a member of the [SatisfIA](https://pik-gane.github.io/satisfia/) research group to investigate aspiration-based reinforcement learning.

## ♘ Chess improvement

After starting to play in late 2022, chess improvement is one of my favourite hobbies and I document my journey here.
