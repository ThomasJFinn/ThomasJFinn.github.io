# 5.Ng5!? in the Caro-Kann Defense, Karpov Variation

If black enters the Caro-Kann Defense, Karpov Variation without knowing about 5.Ng5!?, then they must navigate a narrow path to equality. In this game, black misses a chance to stabilise and struggles to coordinate their pieces. With a king stranded in the centre and loss of material imminent, black resigns on move 16.

**1.e4 c6 2.d4 d5 3.Nc3 dex4 4.Nex4 Nd7**

The idea behind 4...Nd7 is to prepare for ...Ngf6 to displace white's central knight. The immediate 4...Nf6 concedes the doubling of pawns but is perfectly playable for black. The most popular response is 4...Bf5 but we do not venture into the mainline here. 

**5.Ng5!?**

Moving the same piece three times in a row in the opening seems to be breaking open principles. When analysing this line in Anand-Bologan, 2003, Graham Burgess in *The Mammoth Book of the World's Greatest Chess Games* notes that general principles are trumped by concrete play. The knight on d7 seems misplaced and sacrificial ideas revolving around the f7 square are immediate. 

5...h6? is met by the awkward 6.Ne6. The knight is immune to capture and black must navigate an unpleasant opening phase.

5...Nb6 attempts to untangle but has used two moves to put the knight on a poor square. 

**5...Ngf6 6.Bd3 h6 7.Ne6**

6...e6 is preferable to 6...h6. While the bishop on c8 is behind the pawn chain, it allows black to develop the bishop on f8 and castle kingside. 6...h6 also weakens the g6 square and the knight cannot be captured due to 7...fex6?? 8.Bg6#. 

The sharp nature of the position is illuminated in the famous *Deep Blue - Kasparov, Game 6, 1997*. Here, Kasparov opts for 6...e6 7.N1f3 h6? 8.Nxe6! The theory is that Kasparov did no believe the Deep Blue had the ability to correctly evaluate that it would have enough compensation for the knight sacrifice. Kasparov resigned on move 19. The story is complicated by the fact that Deep Blue had 8.Nxe6 programmed into its opening book by experts and would not have played it on its' own terms. Modern computer engines do find the critical sacrifice.
