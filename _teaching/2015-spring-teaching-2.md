Black misses an opportunity to stabilise after a sharp opening and contends with a king that is stranded in the centre. Unable to untangle their position and with material loss inevitable, black resigns on move 16. 

**1.e4 c6 2.d4 d5 3.Nc3 dex4 4.Nex4 Nd7**

The idea behind 4...Nd7 is to prepare for ...Ngf6 to displace white's central knight. The immediate 4...Nf6 concedes the doubling of pawns but is perfectly playable for black. The most popular response is 4...Bf5 but we do not venture into the mainline here. 

**5.Ng5!?**

Moving the same piece three times in a row in the opening seems to be breaking open principles. When analysing this line in Anand-Bologan, 2003, Graham Burgess in *The Mammoth Book of the World's Greatest Chess Games* notes that general principles are trumped by concrete play. The knight on d7 seems misplaced and sacrificial ideas revolving around the f7 square are immediate. 

5...h6? is met by the awkward 6.Ne6. The knight is immune to capture and black must navigate an unpleasant opening phase.

5...Nb6 attempts to untangle but has used two moves to put the knight on a poor square. 

**5...Ngf6 6.Bd3 h6 7.Ne6**

6...e6 is preferable to 6...h6. While the bishop on c8 is behind the pawn chain, it allows black to develop the bishop on f8 and castle kingside. 6...h6 also weakens the g6 square and the knight cannot be captured due to 7...fex6?? 8.Bg6#. 

The sharp nature of the position is illuminated in the famous *Deep Blue - Kasparov, Game 6, 1997*. Here, Kasparov opts for 6...e6 7.N1f3 h6? 8.Nxe6! The theory is that Kasparov did not believe that Deep Blue had the ability to correctly evaluate that it would have enough compensation for the knight sacrifice. Kasparov resigned on move 19. The story is complicated by the fact that Deep Blue had 8.Nxe6 programmed into its opening book by experts and would not have played it on its' own terms. Modern computer engines do find the critical sacrifice.

**7... Qa5+ 8.Bd2 Qb6**

The immediate 7...Qb6 is preferable as white develops their dark-squared bishop with tempo.

**9.Nxf8?**

White should be brave and play 9.Nf3. If 9...fxe6 then black loses with 10.Bg6+ Kd8. White is down a piece but black's position is on the verge of collapse. Tal-Oll, 1986 follows this line. The premature capture with 9.Nxf8 acquires the bishop-pair but at the cost of allowing black to equalise. Black needs to recapture with the knight to keep the possibility of castling kingside. 

**9...Rxf8? 10.Nf3 Qxb2 11.O-O**

Black is a pawn up but white is fully developed with eyes on a king in the centre.

**11...Nfd5**

Black centralises the knight in the hope to force some exchanges. However, there is not enough time.

**12.Re1 N7f6 13.Rb1 Qa3 14.Qe2**

12.c4 is even stronger, evicting the knight and obtaining and stranglehold on the centre. 

**14...b6**

Mate is only avoidable with severe loss of material.

**15.c4 Nc7 16.Bb4 1-0**
