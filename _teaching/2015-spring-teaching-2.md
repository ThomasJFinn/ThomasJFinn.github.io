# 5.Ng5!? in the Caro-Kann Defense, Karpov Variation

If black enters the Caro-Kann Defense, Karpov Variation without knowing about 5.Ng5!?, then they must navigate a narrow path to equality. In this game, black misses a chance to stabilise and struggles to coordinate their pieces. With a king stranded in the centre and loss of material imminent, black resigns on move 16.

**1.e4 c6 2.d4 d5 3.Nc3 dex4 4.Nex4 Nd7**
